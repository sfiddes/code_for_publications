Code used to generate the CMIP6 SO radiation bias plot in the paper: Mallet et al. (2022) 'Untangling the influence of Antarctic and Southern Ocean life on clouds', in prep. 

We have used the Climate Finder search ESGF data at NCI (CleF) to select available CMIP6 models on the NCI https://clef.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
We have used models from the CMIP historical experiment (atmosphere) and only considered one variant per model to avoid biassing a particular model/model family in the ensemble. 

Equlibrium climate sensititvity has been taken from: https://github.com/mzelinka/cmip56_forcing_feedback_ecs and is described in Zelinka et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085782

We have used the Clouds and the Earthâ€™s Radiant Energy System - Energy Balanced and Filled (CERES-EBAF) Level 3b incoming shortwave radiation product at the surface (Loeb et al., 2018), avaiblable on the NCI ESGF Obs4MIPs replica https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/
