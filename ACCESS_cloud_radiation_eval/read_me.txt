This is the code that performs the analysis presented in Fiddes et al. 2022 'Southern Ocean cloud and shortwave radiation biases in a nudged climate model simulation: does the model ever get it right?' In review, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-259 

The code should be executed in the following order: 
- pre_processing.ipynb
- generate_kmeans.ipynb
- post_processing.ipynb
- analysis+plots.ipynb 

The ACCESS data generated by the generate_kmeans.ipynb and post_processing.ipynb can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6004062. The observational data used in pre-processing.ipynb is free to download. See the notebook for details on how to download.
