This is the code to perform the analysis in Fiddes et al. (2022) 'Insights into the cloud-radiative bias of the Southern Ocean using
machine learning and feature importance metrics' in preparaiton for publication 

1. pre-process.ipynb: organises the data needed for analysis 
2. run_XGBoost+SHAP_control.ipynb: run the XGBoost model and SHAP analysis for the control run 
3. run_XGBoost+SHAP_ice.ipynb: run the XGBoost model and SHAP analysis for the ice experiment run
4. analysis+plots_ML.ipynb: all plots and stats presented in paper
